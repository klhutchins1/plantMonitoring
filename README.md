Meteor Version of the plant monitor

Doesn't do much at the moment. Just getting settings save to DB and geting used to Meteor

Will eventually be working on RasPi, to monitor custom gardens and plants.

Could automate watering and light depending on time, or other variables ??????

Gardens - Can have 1 or 100. This is to group the plants. All plants will be a member of a Garden. Each garden can be monitored,
or contolled. Will be created for a certain size, add plants a certain locations.

Plants - Can have 1 or 100 per Garden. Can have optimal settings for the plant type.
Ex. tomatoes need * of water per day, * amount of light ever * hours, should be kept at * temp.
